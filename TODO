 * Switching delimiters on the fly does not currently work.

 * Leading spaces in comments are not preserved.

 * Partials works by looking up variables in _G or in the specified 
   environment, but I'm not really keen on this as it can lead to troubles

   (e.g., Mercury).

 * Reading partials from files is not supported yet.
