 * Switching delimiters on the fly does not currently work.

 * Partials works by looking up variables in _G or in the specified 
   environment, but I'm not really keen on this as it can lead to troubles 
   when used where an heavy functions environment manipulation occurs 
   (e.g., Mercury).

 * Reading partials from files is not supported yet.
